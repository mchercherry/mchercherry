- Aye, what's up! I'm Cherry. I'm a silly little guy.
- I love game design, art, rats, and Will Wood
- In my free time, I like to work on making video games! I have a real love for Visual Novels and RPGs. I draw my own assets and I compose my own music.
- My favorite color is green, and my favorite fruit are cherries! It's actually where my name comes from, haha. I'm a graphic design major, and I really enjoy web development! My favorite emoticons are (-: and (^: because I think they look funny with their noses. 
- Thanks for reading!üçí
